Hotel Data Analytics for AtliqGrandâ€™s

Introduction
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of hotel bookings data using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset contains information about hotel bookings, including guest details, booking dates, room types, and more. The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights from the data, starting from data cleaning, followed by data exploration, transformation, and generating insights.
 
 1.Data Cleaning

- Handling Missing Values
Clean the collected data by identifying and handling null values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This ensures that the analysis is based on reliable data.
 
- Removing Duplicates
Duplicate rows were removed based on a combination of guest details and booking information.

2. Data Exploration

- Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics provided insights into the central tendencies and dispersions of numerical features such as 'lead_time', 'stays_in_weekend_nights', 'stays_in_week_nights', etc.
- Data Visualization
Data visualization using bar plots, histograms, and pie charts helped visualize distributions, booking sources, room types, and cancellation rates.

3. Data Transformation

- Feature Engineering
New features like 'total_stays', which is the sum of weekend and week nights, were created. 'booking_date' and 'check-in_date' were converted to datetime objects to calculate lead times.
- Encoding Categorical Variables
Categorical variables like 'hotel', 'meal', 'country', etc., were encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding to prepare them for analysis.
